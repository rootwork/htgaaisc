**Medication abortion is safe and effective, and abortion pills have been used around the world for decades.**

Although Americans lost the constitutional right to abortion with the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland [has since said](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-attorney-general-states-cant-ban-fda-approved-abortion-pills-2022-6) that states can’t ban abortion pills that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Abortion pills are FDA-approved for ending a pregnancy up to 10 weeks, but they’re also used off-label later than this in some states.

**[Women On Web provides abortion pills by mail](https://www.womenonweb.org/en/i-need-an-abortion)** in exchange for a donation, and also offers other consultive services.

[Self-Managed Abortion; Safe & Supported](https://abortionpillinfo.org/) is a program of Women Help Women and has information and counselors available for the use of abortion pills. [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/) also has comprehensive information on medication abortion.
